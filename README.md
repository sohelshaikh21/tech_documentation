# JavaScript Tutorial (JavaScript - MDN)

### User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
### User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
### User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
### User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java").
### User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
### User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
### User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).
